# DiscordIJ
A plugin for the IntelliJ IDEA IDE that adds Discord Rich Presence support.

> This is my first Intellij plugin, I am not familiar enough with the intellij API, so this plugin only implements the basic functions, I should consider adding more customization in the future

## Add icons support for an IDE/File?
If you want to add icons support for an IDE/File, please submit a pull request.
You need to provide a png file with 512x512 resolution and the name of the IDE/File.
Also, for the file icon, unless it is a source file of a popular language, there is no need to add an icon separately, and it is enough to use the fallback icon
